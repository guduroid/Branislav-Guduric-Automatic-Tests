Automatic Tests

Greetings and thank you for using my tests for CoinMarketCap.

For the development of the tests, I have used IntelliJ IDEA software. 

All tests are in 3 separated files:
1) CoinMarketCapFrontEndTest.java
	Here are tests for FrontEnd part of the technical test
2) CoinMarketCapBackEndTest.java
	Here are tests for the first part of BackEnd part of the technical test
3) CoinMarketCapBackEnd2ndTest.java
	Here are tests for the second part of BackEnd part of the technical test

You can run all of the tests by opening one of the files and run the tests manually:
	If you want to run tests separately, right-click on the body of the test and click on Run "Test-Name". 
	If you want to  run all of the tests at once, right-click on the body of the class and click on Run "File-name"
